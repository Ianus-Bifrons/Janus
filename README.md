# Janus-aka-Komnis

I Am Janus.

I'm a wannabe Information Security Engineer and a CS Undergraduate at the [American College of Thessaloniki](https://www.act.edu). I try to work on many different aspects of security and partake in CTF's. I also like programming with some projects in development.

This page works as my personal footprint on the internet. A small whoami so to say. It also provides links to my pressence on different platforms, as well as different links that refer you to my personal technical, literarily, and anything else, recommendations and opinions
